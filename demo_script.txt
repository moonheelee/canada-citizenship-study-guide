Good evening, everyone at the Vancouver AI Community Meetup! I'm delighted to share my project, the Canada Citizenship Study Guide. This project highlights the integration of OpenAI's Assistants API and Streamlit to transform the educational experience.

Before we dive in, let's gauge our collective experience. Could you please raise your hand if you're familiar with OpenAI's Assistants API? Thank you. And who here has used Streamlit for web application development? Great to see that!

I'd like to focus on the Assistants API's capability for stateful interactions. Unlike basic APIs, this allows our application to maintain conversation context over multiple exchanges, crucial for a coherent learning experience. The study guide's content, uploaded as a document, is directly accessible by the API, enabling it to reference specific information in response to user queries.

Compared to LangChain, which is tailored for complex AI conversations, the Assistants API offers a straightforward yet robust method for interacting with OpenAI's language models, making it ideal for educational tools like ours where direct and efficient user interaction is key. For detailed insights into the API, you can visit the OpenAI Assistants API Overview.


Let's move to the live demonstration. You'll see how the AI provides context-aware responses and how Streamlit's user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience. Your feedback, especially from a developer's perspective, is invaluable for the project's growth.
