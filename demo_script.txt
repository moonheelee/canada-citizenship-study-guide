"Good evening, everyone! Imagine having a study guide that's made just for you. With all the AI tools available, why not create something unique? I'm Moonhee, thrilled to be here tonight. I'm going to show you a cool, practical way to use OpenAI's latest Assistants API through my project, the Canada Citizenship Study Guide."

"Our project is like magic â€“ just upload your material, and the Assistants API takes care of the rest. It's really that simple. Once your content is up, the API does all the work, so you can relax."

"Sure, there's some coding involved, but it's straightforward. You decide what you want the guide to do, and the API handles the complex stuff. This way, we focus on our goals, and let the API do the heavy lifting."

"Now, let's switch gears and see this in action with a live demo."

"You're also welcome to check out my GitHub repository. You'll find the source code there, along with detailed instructions for the Assistant and all the materials you need."

"Thanks a lot for your time tonight. I can't wait to hear your questions and get insights from all of your unique experiences."
